This is a React project for an assesment in Adalab.

In this exercise, I had to create an app with a list of Pok√©mons. The data was extracted from an object in a JSON file (pokemons.json), and used in the different components by using "props".

In the component PokeList, I have created a list of 10 cards of Pokemons which include its name, a picture, and its type. This Pokemons info can be found in a lower component, Pokemons.js. The Pokemon type info is also a list inside each Pokemons card.
